# Philosophy: Hindu Concepts in Soul AI

## The Three-Faculty Model

In Hindu philosophy (particularly Vedanta and Yoga), the inner instrument (*antahkarana*) operates through distinct faculties:

### Manas (Mind)
- The **sensory-emotional mind** that receives impressions and reacts
- Processes through feelings, desires, fears, and instincts
- In Soul AI: The emotional/intuitive module that gives gut reactions
- Responds with valence (-1 to +1) reflecting emotional charge

### Buddhi (Intellect)
- The **discriminative faculty** that judges, decides, and reasons
- Applies *viveka* (discrimination) to distinguish real from unreal
- In Soul AI: The rational module that applies dharmic principles
- Guided by *satya* (truth), *ahimsa* (non-harm), and *karma* (consequence)

### Sanskaras (Habits/Impressions)
- **Accumulated impressions** from past experience that shape present response
- Also called *vasanas* (deep-seated tendencies)
- In Soul AI: The habit database that activates relevant patterns
- Weight formula: `base_weight * log2(repetition_count + 1)` — repeated habits grow stronger

## The Atman (Synthesizer)

The *Atman* is the true Self — the witness consciousness that stands behind all three faculties. It does not belong to any single faculty but integrates them all.

In Soul AI, the Synthesizer represents the Atman: it receives all three perspectives and speaks as the unified self. Where faculties conflict, it acknowledges the inner tension honestly.

## Dharmic Principles

The Buddhi module is guided by core dharmic principles:

- **Satya (Truth):** Commitment to honest, accurate assessment
- **Ahimsa (Non-harm):** Considering impact on all beings
- **Viveka (Discrimination):** Distinguishing lasting truth from fleeting impulse
- **Karma:** Understanding that actions have consequences
- **Vairagya (Detachment):** Ability to assess without clinging to outcomes

## Weight Distribution

Default weights reflect philosophical hierarchy:
- **Buddhi: 40%** — In spiritual development, intellect/discrimination should guide
- **Manas: 35%** — Emotions are vital signals but should not dominate
- **Sanskaras: 25%** — Habits inform but can also trap; they advise, not decide

These weights are configurable, reflecting that different situations may call for different balances.
